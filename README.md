# Resume Builder

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5319f105-9ecb-4fc0-8d29-47d37efca5a3)

This project was originally designed as a challenge for [TUDCTF 2024](https://ctftime.org/event/2487). I've since repurposed it to create my own resume in.

## CTF Challenge

Start the challenge with `docker compose up --build` and access `http://localhost:3000` to see the result.

You can also run the challenge outside of Docker with `yarn install` and `yarn dev`.

A solve script can be found in [./solve.js](solve.js)
